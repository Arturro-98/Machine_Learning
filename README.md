Machine Learning project: applied various Machine Learning techniques to predict personal income based on individual and 
demographic features. It consists of continuous and discrete instances to solve a classification problem. This project involved 
using traditional Machine Learning models and techniques like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNeighborsClassifier, MLPClassifier, 
Random Forests Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and a few others, plus additionally enhanced by deployment of 
RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
